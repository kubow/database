### Tightly coupled semantic model

- lots of data sources
- unified it to data warehouse, data lake, or nowadays data source managers
- companies succeeded with unifying the access to these data

- users are using own tools to see data and build analytics
	- Mainstream: PowerBI, Tableau, Looker
	- Data Scientis teams: R Studio, MATLAB
- each tool has its own mechanism to do the calulations (or metrics)
- do this in each BI tool separately -> incosistent results
- the bigger the customer is the bigger the problem is
