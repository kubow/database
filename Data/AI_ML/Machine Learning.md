The overall steps for Machine Learning/Deep Learning are:

- Data Preparation
	- Collect data
	- Check for anomalies, missing data and clean the data
	- Feature Engineering (trasmformations, polynomials, day-of-week columns...)
- Training
	- Perform statistical analysis and initial visualization
	- Build models
	- Check the accuracy (Model Evaluation)
- Deployment
	- Present the results
	- Model Operations (placed in hosted environment)
  
Machine learning tasks can be classified into:
- Supervised learning: use reposnse varaible, supervised alghoritms to iteratively learn based on a defined objective
- Unsupervised learning: without a clear variable to guide the process, identify patterns that exist in data sets
- Semi-supervised learning
- Reinforcement learning: develop strategies based on experiencing the rewards that result from interactions with a simulated environment
