### Embedded analytics

technology designed to make data analysis and business intelligence more accessible

### Distributed analytics

#### History (natural evolution)

- one data analytics team that takes care about preparing insights and dashboards over data
- people come to ask and rely on this team
- parallel need - more people to see **some** kind of analytics (external/internal)
- information needed to be shared across organization
- BI tools needed to shift to something that is **useful** and **customizable** by different types of
	- businesses
	- semi-technical users

#### Current state

- someone who understands the data on the architecture level (know SQL, how to query)
- rest of people are preparing **parts** of end-user analytics (the name distrbuted)
- responsibility to connect the physical data from their sources into so called **semantic model**
- building analytics easily by drag&dropping, even without SQL knowing code or understanding the data
- guarantee to see data dedicated to specific users
- play with it
- data needs to be shared across different strucutre (granularity and hierarchy -huge and varies)
- same mechanisms underneath but people see just relevant data
