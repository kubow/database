Level of abstraction:
- **Conceptual data model:** "what" entities and relationships exist in the system, without going into implementation details.
- **Logical data model:** "how" the data will be structured logically, independent of the specific database system.
- **Physical data model:** how the data will be physically stored using a particular database management system (DBMS).

Data Structure:
- [Relational Model](Modelling_Relational.md)
	- Snowflake
	- Dimensional
	- Entity - Relationship
	- 3NF 
- Hierarchical/Network model: parent-child relationship
- Object-Oriented Concepts
- Entity Attribute Value Model
- Relational algebra
