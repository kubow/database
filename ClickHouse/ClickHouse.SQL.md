ClickHouse's SQL dialect has several important differences compared to other popular SQL databases. Here are some of the key differences:

1.  [Data Types | ClickHouse Docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/) 
	- wide variety of data types, including specialized types for handling arrays, tuples, and complex data structures.
	- supports several custom data types such as Date, DateTime, and UUID.
2. [Functions | ClickHouse Docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/)
	- rich set of built-in functions for data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis
	- support for user-defined functions (UDFs) in several programming languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript.
3.  Query Language: 
	- supports most standard SQL features such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN, and UNION. 
	- several advanced features such as support for subqueries, materialized views, and window functions.
4.  Syntax: ClickHouse's SQL syntax is similar to standard SQL, but it has some differences. For example, ClickHouse uses backticks instead of double quotes to delimit identifiers, and it uses square brackets instead of single quotes for string literals.
    
5.  Indexing: ClickHouse does not use traditional indexing methods like B-trees or hash indexes. Instead, it uses a unique indexing system called 'MergeTree'. It allows for efficient data retrieval by using sorted, compressed data blocks.
    
6.  Aggregation: ClickHouse's aggregation functions are highly optimized and can handle large data sets with high accuracy. It can perform rollups, cube, and grouping sets as well as pivot and unpivot tables.
    

Overall, ClickHouse's SQL dialect is designed for high-performance, big-data analytics and processing, making it a powerful tool for handling large datasets.
