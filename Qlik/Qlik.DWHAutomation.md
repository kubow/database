Data Warehouse Automation used by **Qlik Replicate™** and **Qlik Compose™ for Data Warehouses**

The most significant inefficiency of traditional data warehousing is the requirement to design EDW models that match future queries before a warehouse is created. This is especially painful in today’s world of real-time decision making and rapidly changing business requirements. As a result, EDW teams just can’t keep up. Qlik Data Integration (QDI) solutions for Data Warehouse Automation allows them to quickly design, build, deploy, manage and catalog purpose-built Data Warehouses (especially cloud based) faster than traditional solutions. Consequently, data engineers can meet or exceed the demands for analytics-ready data marts at the speed of change and help the business capitalize on data-driven decisions.

## Real-time data ingest and update

A simple and universal solution for continually ingesting enterprise data into popular data warehouses in real-time.

## Automated and continuous refinement

A model-driven approach for quickly designing, building, and managing purpose-built data warehouses on-premises or in the cloud.

## Trusted, enterprise-ready data

Deliver a smart enterprise-scale data catalog to securely share all of your derived data sets, marts and beyond with business users.

Complete and cohesive analytics ecosystem (For many types and sources)

Data Reusability and reuse (to minimize duplicates)

Scalability and Elasticity (increase, reduce resources to meet needs)

Near real-time processing (to eliminate batch bottlenecks)

Automation (to reduce scripting requirements and bottlenecks)
