## Smart Integrated DataOps Catalog

IT needs to manage large data collections.
Data consumers need to find, understand and enhance data.

Qlik DataOps catalog helps by
- organizing (metadata and data linked in the same catalog)
- documenting
- describing
- automation and scaling
- manage large data collections more efficiently

## Change Data Capture

- idetyfying and capturing changes made to data in a database (continous & real-time)
- delivering those changes to another database or other type of data repository
- a progressive and modern UI, easy to manage and automate with low TCO 
- angentless and log based with minimal impact to source system

## Data Lake Pileline Automation & Orchestration

Qlik is the only solution that combines real-time chnage data capture and complete automation.
- Traditional approach requires manual scripting and multiple tool sets
- Qlik automates creation and management of pipelines
- Qlik helps by efficient change data transfer and automation of data transformations
	- landing
	- staging
	- refining
	- provisioning
- Automates the creation of tables, reorganize data structures and track lineage to deliver a managed data lake
- Uses Apache Spark and Apache Hive for refinement

## Data Warehouse Automation

Traditional Scripted Approach:
- Unwieldy
- Time-consuming
- Error prone
- Not keeping up with business requirements

The Qlik Difference
- Agile, model-driven approach to automation design, implementation and updating
	- Automated table creation, instantiation and mappings
	- Rapid Data Mart creation
	- Contionus real-time streaming CDC
	- No scripting or coding required
- ETL (E-LT) code generation for DW
- Enforced best practice architecture

## Data Preparation

From raw to business-ready
