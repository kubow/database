[SingleStore | The Real-Time Data Platform for Intelligent Applications](https://www.singlestore.com/)
SingleStore (formerly known as MemSQL) is primarily written in C++.

The technology behind SingleStore involves several key features:

1. **In-Memory Processing:** SingleStore leverages in-memory processing to accelerate data access and analytics. By keeping data in memory, it can significantly reduce query latency.
    
2. **Distributed Architecture:** SingleStore is built on a distributed architecture, allowing it to scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster. This enables the system to handle large volumes of data and high transactional loads.
    
3. **SQL Support:** SingleStore supports standard SQL queries, making it compatible with existing tools and applications that use SQL. This makes it easier for organizations to integrate SingleStore into their existing infrastructure.
    
4. **Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP):** SingleStore is designed to support both transactional and analytical processing in real-time. This allows businesses to run operational and analytical workloads on the same database platform without the need for separate systems.
    
5. **Data Pipelines:** SingleStore supports real-time data pipelines, enabling organizations to ingest, process, and analyze streaming data in real-time. This is crucial for applications that require up-to-date insights from rapidly changing data.
    
6. **Integration with Other Technologies:** SingleStore may integrate with other technologies and tools, such as data visualization tools, business intelligence platforms, and data integration solutions, to provide a comprehensive data ecosystem.
